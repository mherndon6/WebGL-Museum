/*
Notes:
z is acting inverted. not sure why... so I just inverted the wall positions for now ---- probably just the way i defined camera or something
I think this is a pretty good model, just have to define the rooms based on the vars below, see: http://imgur.com/ecyLIHv
Cycle through rendering rooms by clicking on canvas for now
Half-fixed fullscreen, gotta press f again to leave instead of esc. esc in fullscreen doesnt fire events probably for security
